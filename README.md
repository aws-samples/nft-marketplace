This repo contains the demo code from the NFT marketplace application discussed on the blogs:

- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-1-develop-a-full-stack-serverless-nft-application-with-amazon-managed-blockchain/

- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-2-develop-a-full-stack-serverless-nft-application-with-amazon-managed-blockchain/ 

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. An active AWS account
3. AWS CLI (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

## Setup

Clone the repository and run the following commands to setup the code ($ is not part of the command):

```console
$ npm install -g ganache-cli truffle
$ cd ShareToWinContract
$ npm install
$ cd ../ShareToWinRestApi
$ npm install
$ cd ../ShareToWinWeb
$ npm install
$ aws dynamodb create-table --table-name ShareToWin --attribute-definitions AttributeName=AssetID,AttributeType=N --key-schema AttributeName=AssetID,KeyType=HASH --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1 
```

## Run

Open four terminal windows. 

1. On the first terminal window make sure you are in the ShareToWinContract folder. Run the following command to start Ganache development server by running the ganache-cli

```console
npx ganache-cli  --acctKeys ../ShareToWinRestApi/ethaccounts.json
```
2. On the second terminal window make sure you are in the ShareToWinContract folder. Run the following command to start truffle console.

```console
truffle console --network development
```
Once connected to truffle console, issue the migrate command. 

```console
migrate
```

The migrate command will deploy the smart contract on ganache development network and display the deployed contract address

    value sent:          0 ETH
    total cost:          0.08193354 ETH

3. On the third terminal window make sure you are in the ShareToWinRestApi folder. Copy the contract address that is displayed on the second terminal when you ran the migrate truffle command into the envExport.sh file and run the following commands

```console
source envExport.sh
npx nodemon --delay 1000ms index.js
```

This will start the express web server and listen on port 4080

4. On the fourth window make sure you are in the ShareToWinWeb folder. Start the react web front end by entering the command

```console
npm run start
```
